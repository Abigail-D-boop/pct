# pct  &middot; [![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/ITSLeeds/pct/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/ITSLeeds/pct?branch=master) [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/stats19.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ITSLeeds/pct)

The goal of pct is to increase the reproducibility of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), a research project and web application hosted at [www.pct.bike](http://www.pct.bike/).
For an overview of what the PCT can do, click on the previous link and try it out.
If you want to know how PCT works, be able to reproduce the results it generates, and build scenarios of cycling uptake to inform transport policies enabling cycling in cities worldwide, this package is for you.

## Installation

You can install the development version of the package as follows:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/pct")
```


<!-- You can install the released version of pct from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("pct") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Load the package as follows:

```{r}
library(pct)
```


## Example for Leeds

This example shows how scenarios of cycling uptake, and how 'distance decay' works (short trips are more likely to be cycled than long trips).

The input data looks like this (origin-destination data and geographic zone data):

```{r input-data}
class(od_leeds)
od_leeds[c(1:3, 12)]
class(zones_leeds)
zones_leeds[1:3, ]
```

The `stplanr` package can be used to convert the non-geographic OD data into geographic desire lines as follows: 

```{r desire}
library(sf)
desire_lines = stplanr::od2line(flow = od_leeds, zones = zones_leeds[2])
plot(desire_lines[c(1:3, 12)])
```

We can convert these straight lines into routes with a routing service, e.g.:

```{r}
routes_fast = stplanr::line2route(desire_lines, route_fun = stplanr::route_cyclestreet)
```

We got useful information from this routing operation.
We will add the desire line data onto vital data from the routes (from a cycling uptake perspective, distance and hilliness of routes):

```{r}
routes_vital = sf::st_sf(
  cbind(
  sf::st_drop_geometry(desire_lines[c(1:3, 12)]),
  sf::st_drop_geometry(routes_fast[c("length", "av_incline")]),
  geometry = routes_fast$geometry
  ))
plot(routes_vital)
```

Now we estimate cycling uptake:

```{r}
routes_vital$uptake = uptake_pct_govtarget(distance = routes_vital$length, gradient = routes_vital$av_incline)
routes_vital$bicycle_govtarget = routes_vital$bicycle +
  round(routes_vital$uptake * routes_vital$all)
```

Let's see how many people started cycling:

```{r}
sum(routes_vital$bicycle_govtarget) - sum(routes_vital$bicycle)
```

Nearly 1000 more people cycling to work, just in 10 desire is not bad!
What % cyling is this, for those routes?

```{r}
sum(routes_vital$bicycle_govtarget) / sum(routes_vital$all)
sum(routes_vital$bicycle) / sum(routes_vital$all)
```

It's gone from 4% to 11%, a realistic increase if cycling were enabled by good infrastructure and policies.

Now: where to prioritise that infrastructure and those policies?

```{r}
rnet = stplanr::overline2(routes_vital, attrib = c("bicycle", "bicycle_govtarget"))
lwd = rnet$bicycle_govtarget / mean(rnet$bicycle_govtarget)
plot(rnet["bicycle_govtarget"], lwd = lwd)
```

We can view the results in an interactive map and share with policy makers, stakeholders, and the public!
E.g. (see interactive map [here](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/474074)):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mapview::mapview(rnet, zcol = "bicycle_govtarget", lwd = lwd * 2)
```

## Next steps and further resources (work in progress)

- Add additional scenarios of cycling uptake from different places (e.g. goCambridge)
- Add additional distance decay functions
- Make it easy to use data from other cities around the world
- Show how to create raster tiles of cycling uptake
