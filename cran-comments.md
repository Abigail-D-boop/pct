Minor change to fix errors on CRAN tests caused by changes to sf in 2020.


## Test environments
* local Ubuntu install, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci)
* cyclecstreets dependency requires an API, so some tests will be skipped if not provided.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
